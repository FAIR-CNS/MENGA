# MENGA
Multimodal Environment for Neuroimaging and Genomic Analysis
MENGA is a platform for the integration of imaging data and Allen Human Brain Atlas mRNA data. MENGA aims to provide a comprehensive environment to investigate correlation patterns between various imaging modalities and gene expression profiles based on the Allen Brain Atlas.

The project comes from a collaboration between the Department of Information Engineering (DEI), University of Padova with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Kingâ€™s College, London (UK).

<b>Note: the genomic database is too heavy to be shared on GitHub. Please find it at: http://fair.dei.unipd.it/require-software or http://www.nitrc.org/projects/menga/ or https://figshare.com/articles/MENGA_2_0/2068077 </b>

Image data can be found in the figshare repository (dopamine PET and SPET images, https://figshare.com/articles/Image_data/2068011; MR-based water content, https://figshare.com/articles/MR_based_absolute_myelin_water_image/2068047; serotonin and dopamine D2 PET images: https://figshare.com/articles/Serotonin_and_dopamine_D2_PET_images/2068044).

<b>We have now published the reference paper of MENGA on PlosOne, in which all the aspects of the software and its functionalities are described in details: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148744  </b>

Current version is 2.0
