# MENGA
Multimodal Environment for Neuroimaging and Genomic Analysis
MENGA is a platform for the integration of imaging data and Allen Human Brain Atlas mRNA data. MENGA aims to provide a comprehensive environment to investigate correlation patterns between various imaging modalities and gene expression profiles based on the Allen Brain Atlas.

The project comes from a collaboration between the Department of Information Engineering (DEI), University of Padova with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), Kingâ€™s College, London (UK).
